<h1>When to Use Which:</h1>
<h2>Abstract Classes:</h2>
--> Use abstract classes when you want to provide a common base class with shared implementation for its subclasses.<br>
--> When you need to declare fields (variables) that are shared among subclasses.<br>
--> When you want to provide a common constructor for subclasses.<br>

<h2>Interfaces:</h2>
--> Use interfaces when you want to define a contract that multiple classes can implement.<br>
--> When you want to achieve multiple inheritance of type.<br>
--> When you want to provide a common set of methods for unrelated classes.<br>
